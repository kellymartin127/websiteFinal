        A Little Bit about me, my name is Kelly Rose Brigid Martin, although most people just call me
        Kell. I am 21 years old and I am the founder of three businesses, and Iâ€™m currently in the
        process of buying my first commercial property. All three of my businesses are primarily if not
        entirely ecommerce based. I operate a car detailing business, social media marketing team, and
        finally a baby department store. I've always found it important to diversify yourself in business to
        not only learn but to see what you take to.However, I am currently looking to move away from
        these endeavours and move towards the hospitality business and real estate development, I am
        currently in the process of purchasing a country club as my first attempt at the hospitality
        business. I have already flipped multiple condos and townhouses which first sparked my love for
        property development. The main thing I want people to know is that there is always a way to get
        started in business no matter your age you just have to be creative and find your niche, I am here to help you do that.
